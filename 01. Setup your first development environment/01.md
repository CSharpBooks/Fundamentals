# Setup your first development environment

To be able to learn programming you will need to have some programs that make your life easier.
No reasonable developer will want to write code inside of Notepad or Word, or share code throught USB drives.
In this chapter we will help you setup your development environment.



## Your IDE

An IDE comes in all sorts and flavours and as of late there are a few really solid options.
The top 3 IDE's for C# currently are:

- [Visual Studio](https://www.visualstudio.com/)
- [Visual Studio Code](https://www.visualstudio.com/)
- [Rider](https://www.jetbrains.com/rider/)

### Which IDE fits me?

If you are new to the programming world it can be quite hard to choose an IDE as they all are very different from eachother while accomplishing the same thing.
Luckily there are a few points that can help you choose an IDE.

Visual Studio is the most common choice and the most robust one as well.
The downside to Visual Studio is that it only runs on Windows, and is filled with features which you might not need.

Rider is a good alternative, it is very lightweight while still offering a lot of features and customization.
The cons are that Rider costs money if you are not a student or open source developer.

Visual Studio Code is a lot like Rider, but isn't as polished




## Git client

This is not mandatory but it will certainly make your life easier.
Git is a code sharing framework that enables us to work on the same project with multiple people, and only share our newly updated code.
It will also automatically merge the code that others have send to the central place where the code resides, with just 1 button press.

Just like with your IDE there are a lot of different Git clients, the most common ones being:

- [Gitkraken](https://www.gitkraken.com/)
- [Sourcetree](https://www.sourcetreeapp.com/)
- [TortoiseGit](https://tortoisegit.org/)

### What are the differences?

Gitkraken is the most well known of all inside of the CSharp discord, and most regular people use it, since it is easy to work with and offers a lot of features.

Sourcetree is a bit less intuitive than Gitkraken but it has been around long enough to have a lot of information on the internet available.

TortoiseGit is for the people that prefer to not have a dedicated GUI application.
