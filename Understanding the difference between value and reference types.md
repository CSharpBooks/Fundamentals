# Understanding the difference between value and reference types



To prevent any possible problems in a code it is important to know how value and reference types work.

In C# there are 15 value types  —

* bool
* byte / sbyte
* char
* decimal
* double
* float
* int / unit
* long / ulong
* short / ushort 
* enum

and any struct. As for the reference types, C# has 3 built-in types — *dynamic*, *object* and *string*. And anything else that is a *class*, *interface*, *array* or *delegate* is also considered a reference type.

###So, what ***is*** the difference between them?
